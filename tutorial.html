        <h2>Why is Banker's algorithm used?</h2>
        <p>
          Bankers's algorith is used in process management in operation system and has a purpose
          to help the operating system avoid the unsafe state caused by lack of resources. By itself,
          it is a tool for the safest selection of processes where deadlocks may still happen, but it can be
          used to consturct safety algorithms for prevention of deadlocks.
        </p>
        <h2>How to use the banker's algorithm</h2>
        <p>Banker's algorithm has a set of inputs, which are then used to decide which processes to choose in which order.</p>
        <p>The inputs are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Total resources - vector containing the amounts of each resource.</li>
            <li>Max need - matrix of how much resources each process needs in total to finish</li>
            <li>Allocated - matrix of how much of the total resources were allocated to the process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Calculation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current needed = Max need - allocated </li>
            <li>Available = Total resources - sum of allocated resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Selection:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a process that you can finish with avaliable resources</li>
            <li>Perform the process and return its allocated resources to the available</li>
            <li>Use those resources to finish another process that is pending</li>
            <li>Repeat until all processes are completed or until deadlock (safety algorithm has a way to solve this)</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Game rules:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Read the available resources and process information</li>
            <li>Select a valid process that can be completed</li>
            <li>Select more correct answers in a row to get more points</li>
            <li>If you encounter a deadlock you get extra points</li>
            <li>Complete all levels to see your final score</li>
        </ol>
