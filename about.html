      <p>
        Welcome to the “Interactive Banker’s Algorithm Game”! This game is
        designed to help users understand and master the Banker’s Algorithm, a
        crucial concept in operating systems related to resource allocation and
        deadlock prevention. By playing this game, you will dive into the world
        of resource management, where you’ll get hands-on experience in
        preventing system deadlocks and ensuring efficient allocation of
        resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this game, you will navigate through dynamic scenarios where you’ll
        be responsible for managing resource requests from various processes in
        an operating system. Your goal is to determine whichever process it’s safe to 
        allocate resources to first and solve the problem without causing a deadlock. 
        With each decision, you will learn about safe states, maximum resource needs, 
        and how to analyze system stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is divided into multiple levels with increasing difficulty,
        allowing both beginners and experts to test and improve their
        understanding of the Banker’s Algorithm. The tutorial mode guides you
        step-by-step through the algorithm, helping you grasp the key concepts
        before entering the game mode, where you’ll face real-time challenges
        and scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        With interactive visualizations, auditory cues, and dynamic feedback,
        this game offers a fun and immersive learning experience. Whether you
        are a student, educator, or enthusiast of operating systems, the
        “Interactive Banker’s Algorithm Game” is a great way to explore critical
        concepts while enjoying the process!
